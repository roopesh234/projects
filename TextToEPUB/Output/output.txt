Chapter 6: To the Teacher




iv
To the Teacher
Welcome to 
Future: English for Work, Life, 
and Academic Success
Future
is a six-level, standards-based English language 
course for adult and young adult students. 
Future
provides students with the contextualized academic 
language, strategies, and critical thinking skills 
needed for success in workplace, life, and academic 
settings. 
Future
is aligned with the requirements of the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), the 
English Language Pro±ciency (ELP) and College and 
Career Readiness (CCR) standards, and the National 
Reporting System (NRS) level descriptors. The 21st 
century curriculum in 
Future
’s second edition helps 
students acquire the basic literacy, language, and 
employability skills needed to meet the requirements 
set by the standards.
Future
develops students’ academic and critical 
thinking skills, digital literacy and numeracy, 
workplace and civic skills, and prepares students 
for taking standardized tests. Competency and skills 
incorporating standards are in the curriculum at every 
level, providing a foundation for academic rigor, 
research-based teaching strategies, corpus-informed 
language, and the best of digital tools. 
In revising the course, we listened to hundreds 
of 
Future
teachers and learners and studied the 
standards for guidance. 
Future
continues to be the 
most comprehensive English communication course 
for adults, with its signature sca²olded lessons and 
multiple practice activities throughout. 
Future’s
second edition provides enhanced content, rigorous 
academic language practice, and cooperative 
learning through individual and collaborative practice. 
Every lesson teaches the interpretive, interactive, and 
productive skills highlighted in the standards.
Future
’s Instructional Design
Learner Centered and Outcome Oriented
The student is at the center of 
Future.
Lessons start by 
connecting to student experience and knowledge, and 
then present targeted skills in meaningful contexts. 
Varied and dynamic skill practice progresses from 
controlled to independent in a meticulously sca²olded 
sequence. 
Headers highlighting Depth of Knowledge (DOK) terms 
are used throughout 
Future
to illuminate the skills 
being practiced. Every lesson culminates in an activity 
in which students apply their learning, demonstrate 
their knowledge, and express themselves orally or in 
writing. A DOK glossary for teachers includes speci±c 
suggestions on how to help students activate these 
cognitive skills. 
Varied Practice
Cognitive science has proven what 
Future
always 
knew: Students learn new skills through varied practice 
over time. Content-rich units that contextualize 
academic and employability skills naturally recycle 
concepts, language, and targeted skills. Individual 
and collaborative practice activities engage learners 
and lead to lasting outcomes. Lessons support both 
student collaboration and individual self-mastery. 
Students develop the interpretative, productive, and 
interactive skills identi±ed in the NRS guidelines, 
while using the four language skills of reading, writing, 
listening, and speaking.
Goal Setting and Learning Assessment
For optimal learning to take place, students need to be 
involved in setting goals and in monitoring their own 
progress. 
Future
addresses goal setting in numerous 
ways. In the Student Book, Unit Goals are identi±ed 
on the unit opener page. Checkboxes at the end of 
lessons invite students to evaluate their mastery of the 
material, and suggest additional online practice. 
High-quality assessment aligned to the standards 
checks student progress and helps students prepare 
to take standardized tests. The course-based 
assessment program is available in print and digital 
formats and includes a bank of customizable test 
items. Digital tests are assigned by the teacher and 
reported back in the LMS online gradebook. All 
levels include a midterm and ±nal test. Test items are 
aligned with unit learning objectives and standards. 
The course Placement Test is available in print and 
digital formats. Test-prep materials are also provided 
for speci±c standardized tests. 
One Integrated Program 
Future
provides everything adult English language 
learners need in one integrated program using the 
latest digital tools and time-tested print resources. 
Integrated Skills Contextualized with Rich Content
Future
contextualizes grammar, listening, speaking, 
pronunciation, reading, writing, and vocabulary in 
meaningful activities that simulate real workplace, 
educational, and community settings. A special 
lesson at the end of each unit highlights soft skills at 
work. While providing relevant content, 
Future
helps 
build learner knowledge and equips adults for their 
many roles.
Meeting Work, LiFe, and Education Goals
Future
recognizes that every adult learner brings a 
unique set of work, life, and academic experiences, 
as well as a distinct skill set. With its diverse array

To the Teacher
of print and digital resources, 
Future
provides 
learners with multiple opportunities to practice 
with contextualized materials to build skill mastery. 
Specialized lessons for academic and workplace skill 
development are part of 
Future
’s broad array of print 
and digital resources.
In addition to two units on employment in each 
level, every unit contains a Workplace, Life, and 
Community Skills lesson as well as a Soft Skills at 
Work lesson.
Workplace, LiFe, and Community Skills Lessons
In the second edition, the Life Skills lesson has been 
revised to focus on workplace, life, and community 
skills and to develop the real-life language and civic 
literacy skills required today. Lessons integrate and 
contextualize workplace content. In addition, every 
lesson includes practice with digital skills on a 
mobile device. 
SoFt Skills at Work Lessons
Future
has further enhanced its development of 
workplace skills by adding a Soft Skills at Work lesson 
to each unit. Soft skills are the critical interpersonal 
communication skills needed to succeed in any 
workplace. Students begin each lesson by discussing 
a common challenge in the workplace. Then, while 
applying the lesson-focused soft skill, they work 
collaboratively to ±nd socially appropriate solutions to 
the problem. The log at the back of the Student Book 
encourages students to track their own application of 
the soft skill, which they can use in job interviews.
Academic Rigor
Rigor and respect for the ability and experiences of 
the adult learner have always been central to 
Future.
The standards provide the foundation for academic 
rigor. The reading, writing, listening, and speaking 
practice require learners to analyze, use context 
clues, interpret, cite evidence, build knowledge, 
support a claim, and summarize from a variety of 
text formats. Regular practice with complex and 
content-rich materials develop academic language 
and build knowledge. Interactive activities allow for 
collaboration and exchange of ideas in workplace 
and in academic contexts. 
Future
emphasizes rigor 
by highlighting the critical thinking and problem 
solving skills required in each activity. 
Writing Lessons
In addition to the increased focus on writing in 
Show What You Know activities, 
Future
has added 
a cumulative writing lesson to every unit, a lesson 
that requires students to synthesize and apply their 
learning in a written outcome. Through a highly 
sca²olded approach, students begin by analyzing 
writing models before planning and ±nally producing 
written work of their own. Writing frameworks, Writing 
Skills, and a checklist help guide students through 
the writing process.
Reading lessons
All reading lessons have new, information-rich texts 
and a revised pedagogical approach in line with the 
CCR and ELP standards and the NRS descriptors. 
These informational texts are level appropriate, 
use high-frequency vocabulary, and focus on 
interpretation of graphic information. The readings 
build students’ knowledge and develop their higher-
order reading skills by teaching citation of evidence, 
summarizing, and interpretation of complex 
information from a variety of text formats.
Future
Grows with Your Student
Future
takes learners from absolute beginner level 
through low-advanced English pro±ciency, addressing 
students’ abilities and learning priorities at each level. 
As the levels progress, the curricular content and unit 
structure change accordingly, with the upper levels 
incorporating more advanced academic language and 
skills in the text and in the readings.

IMMIGRANTS IN THE U.S.
Every year, many immigrants come to the U.S. They come from diﬀerent places and for diﬀerent reasons.
Why do immigrants come to the U.S.?
Some people come for work. They get jobs in the U.S. Some people come to be safe. There are problems in their 
countries. Some people come to be with their family.
For example, the parents come ﬁrst. The
children come later to be with their parents.
Where are immigrants from?
Many immigrants come from Central or
South America. They come from countries 
like Mexico and Brazil. Many immigrants 
come from countries in Asia. For example, 
they come from China or India. Some 
immigrants are from Europe or Africa.
Some are from other places.
Are immigrants happy to be here in the U.S.?
It is not easy to leave your home. It is hard
to start a new life in a new country. But more 
than 70% of immigrants in the U.S. say they 
are happy to be here.

Unit 2, Lesson 7
Lesson
Many people in the U.S. work in healthcare. How 
many? More than 12 million.
The biggest number of jobs in healthcare is for nurses. 
They work in hospitals, doctors’ oﬃces, schools, and 
nursing homes. You need a lot of training to be a 
nurse. Nurses go to school for many years.
That is not true for all jobs in healthcare. For some 
jobs, a high school diploma is enough. For example, 
you can be an orderly or a CNA. (CNA means “certiﬁed
nursing assistant.”) Most orderlies get training on the 
job. CNAs take a training course and an exam.
The U.S. has more than 1.5 million CNAs and 
orderlies. They work in hospitals and nursing homes. 
They need to be strong because sometimes they lift 
patients out of bed. They also help people eat, wash, 
or get dressed.
Hospitals and nursing homes need other kinds of 
workers, too. They need cooks, housekeepers, 
custodians, and electricians. They need clerks to do 
oﬃce work. 
Healthcare in the U.S. is growing. It will need more 
workers in the future.

Scientists study how people learn. They study how the 
brain remembers new information. What can scientists 
tell students? 
Set study goals.
Keep your goals small and write them 
in your notebook. For example, write “Listening: Watch TV 
in English for ten minutes. Do it ﬁve days a week.” Look 
at your goals every day. When you reach a goal, make a 
check mark 
next to it. 
Be organized.
Keep all your things for school in a bag 
or backpack. Keep important papers in a binder. Throw 
out papers you don’t need. 
Do one thing at a time.
You cannot learn when you 
are thinking about other things. Don’t watch TV. Don’t 
listen to music. Don’t text friends when you study. Turn 
oﬀ your phone.
Get enough sleep.
Most adults need about 7.5 hours 
of sleep. Sleep helps your brain work better.
Study for a short period every day.
That’s better 
than studying for a long time on one day. You will 
remember more. (Tim has the right idea!)
HELPFUL STUDY HABITS
Sam and Tim are in the same class. Sam plans to 
study vocabulary every Sunday night for 60 
minutes. Tim plans to study vocabulary for 10 
minutes 5 nights a week. Whose plan is better?
Scientists study how we learn.

Do you have cash in your wallet? Maybe you do, and maybe you don’t. Some people almost never
use cash.
In 2011, 36% of Americans used cash for shopping most or all of the time. Today, that number is 
down. People are using other ways to pay. The most common ways are debit cards and credit cards. 
Let’s say you are buying a new jacket at a store. You use a debit card. That card is connected to your 
account at a bank. When you use the card, the money comes out of your account that same day. 
Let’s say you buy the jacket with a credit card instead. A credit card lets you borrow money from the 
credit card company. Later, the company sends you a bill. You need to pay the money back. It is 
better to pay it all back on time. After the payment due date, the company charges interest on the 
money. That is expensive!
Some people never use credit cards. They like using cash.
In the U.S., people often spend more money when they
shop with a credit card. Why? A credit card is a piece
of plastic. Maybe it doesn’t seem like real money.

Academic Skill: Make inferences
You make inferences about things the writer is 
thinking but doesn’t say. For example, this writer 
says, “That is expensive!” You can infer that the 
writer thinks, “Paying interest is a bad idea.”

Home ﬁres are dangerous. Every year in the U.S., about 2,500 
people die from home ﬁres. Smoke alarms save lives. They make 
a loud noise when a ﬁre starts. Smoke alarms give people time to 
leave their homes before a ﬁre gets too big.
Smoke Alarms
Which parts of the home need smoke alarms?
Every bedroom needs a smoke alarm. Every floor of a home needs 
a smoke alarm. When there is no bedroom on a floor, the living 
room needs a smoke alarm. It is good to have a smoke alarm near 
the stairs, too. Smoke alarms go on or near the ceiling.
Who buys the smoke alarms?
People who own a home need to buy smoke alarms. But renters 
do not need to buy them. The law says their landlord needs to put 
smoke alarms in their home to make sure they are safe.
Which parts of the home do not need smoke alarms?
Most kitchens do not need smoke alarms. A smoke alarm should 
not be close to the stove or microwave. Then it will go off when 
someone cooks! A smoke alarm should never be near a window 
or door.

Do you buy fresh food? Are you sure it is fresh? Be careful! Stores 
sometimes sell old food. Check the date on food before you buy it. 
How long can you keep your food at home?
Milk
is usually safe to drink for two to ten days after its sell-by date. Be 
sure to keep it cold.
Eggs
are good for three to ﬁve weeks after their sell-by date. Keep them in 
the refrigerator, too.
Chicken
is diﬀerent. You cannot keep chicken in 
your refrigerator for weeks after the sell-by date. 
The refrigerators in stores are very cold. Your home 
refrigerator isn’t as cold. Freeze chicken or cook it a 
day or two after you buy it. You can keep chicken in 
the freezer for twelve months. You can keep cooked 
chicken in the refrigerator for a week.
Some food, like 
canned food
, doesn’t have a sell-by 
date. But it isn’t good forever. Keep canned food in 
a cool, dry place. Try to use it in twelve months.
Sometimes canned food or 
frozen food
has a 
best-before date or a use-by date. The food will 
taste better before that date.

Lesson
Hurricane
Winds
Beach
Average Tide
Hurricanes are big storms. A hurricane can be 
600 miles across! The winds can be as strong as 
200 mph (miles per hour). The winds move in a 
circle. The center of the circle is called the eye. 
Hurricanes form only over warm ocean water. 
The water needs to be 80 degrees or higher. 
Warmer water makes a storm stronger. When the 
storm hits land, it brings both strong winds and 
heavy rain.
A hurricane also brings a storm surge. It pushes 
ocean water on land. The water moves at 10 to 15 
mph. It can be several feet high. A one-foot storm 
surge can push a car off the road.
Most big storms happen during hurricane 
season. In the Atlantic Ocean, it goes from June 1 
to November 30. During hurricane season, people 
listen for news of storms. A hurricane watch means 
a bad storm might come in the next 36 hours. A 
hurricane warning means a hurricane is coming in 
the next 24 hours. On average, hurricane season 
brings ﬁve or six hurricanes, but sometimes there 
are more. Usually only two are major hurricanes.
In the U.S., hurricanes most often hit the South 
and the Southeast. They do the most damage in 
Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. But they cause 
problems in other states, too.

Your Public Library
The U.S. has more than 16,000 public 
libraries. They 
are open to everyone, and they are free. 
You can do many things at a public library. You can 
read newspapers and magazines. You can study or do 
homework. You can use Wi-Fi to go online. Many 
libraries have computer and English classes. Some have 
information about jobs. All libraries have activities for 
children. For example, some have summer programs. 
Some have homework help after school.
With a library card, you can borrow books, tablets, 
and more! How long can you keep them? Check the 
due date on your receipt. Don’t be late, or you will 
need to pay a ﬁne. The ﬁne might be only ﬁve cents
or a lot more. To get a card, ﬁll out an application.
You will need to show something with your name
and address. For example, show an ID, your driver’s 
license, or a credit card bill. 
Your public library has a website. You can ﬁnd out 
library hours. You can read about events. You can 
borrow e-books and watch movies online. You can 
renew books so you can keep them longer. 
These are only a few reasons to use your public 
library. Go online or visit to learn more.

It’s free. It’s easy. It’s good for you. And guess what? 
You already do it every day. 
What is it? Walking.
When you walk every day: 
You have a lot of energy. Your 
bones get strong. Your heart 
gets strong, too. You prevent 
heart disease and other health 
problems.
For good health, you should 
walk 10,000 steps a day 
(about ﬁve miles). Taking 
10,000 steps a day burns 
about 2,000 to 3,500 calories 
a week. There are 3,500 calories in one pound of 
body fat. So walking can also help you lose weight.
Most people walk 4,000 steps a day. These 4,000 
steps are part of your daily routine. You walk from 
the bedroom to the kitchen. You walk to your car or 
the bus stop. You walk from the entrance of your 
school to your classroom. So you need only 6,000 
more steps a day. 
Here are some ways to add steps to your daily 
routine:
• Don’t take the elevator. Take the stairs.
• Walk when you talk on the phone.
• Get oﬀ the bus one stop early. Then walk the rest
of the way.
• Don’t park near the place you’re going. 
It’s easy. So what are you waiting for? Start walking!
Walk Your Way to Good Health!

When you meet someone for the ﬁrst time, you quickly 
form an opinion about him or her. This opinion is your 
ﬁrst impression of the person. That person forms a ﬁrst 
impression of you, too. You want to 
make a good impression. This is very 
important in a job interview. 
Before Your Interview
Choose the right clothes to wear. 
Your clothes and hair should look 
clean and neat. Be sure you smell 
good, but don’t wear much perfume 
or cologne. 
During Your Interview 
When you meet the interviewer, 
make 
eye contact and smile. Shake hands 
ﬁrmly. Stand about three feet away. When you sit 
down, try to look relaxed but sit up in your chair. Lean 
forward a little and look at the interviewer. This shows 
you are listening. Put your hands on 
your lap, not in your pockets. Don’t 
touch your face or hair.
At the End of Your Interview
When the interview is ﬁnished, shake 
hands again. Remember that in the 
U.S., most people like a strong 
handshake. Make eye contact and 
smile. 
Say thank you.
In a job interview, the right clothes 
and good body language can help you 
make a good ﬁrst impression.

Hannah: 
Good morning. This is Hannah Charles 
with Greenville News Radio. You’re 
listening to The Food Show. Do you have 
questions about ±ood? Well, call and ask. 
Now here’s our ²rst caller . . . 
Greg: 
Hi Hannah. I’m Greg Johnson. My wi±e 
says that I don’t eat healthy ±ood. She 
says, “Eat more ±ruit and vegetables.” But 
I’m a meat and potatoes man. 
Hannah: 
OK, Mr. Meat and Potatoes. Tell me, do 
you like chicken?
Greg: 
Sure. I eat a lot o± chicken.
Hannah: 
And do you like grilled chicken or ±ried 
chicken?
Greg: 
I like grilled chicken and ±ried chicken.
Hannah: 
OK. Now let me ask you a question. How 
many calories are there in a piece o± ±ried 
chicken?
Greg: 
Hmm. I don’t know.
Hannah: 
250 calories.
Greg: 
250 calories!
Hannah: 
That’s right, but in a piece o± grilled 
chicken there are only about 100 calories. 
So, the choice is easy. The next time you 
have chicken, eat grilled chicken, not ±ried.
Greg: 
OK. That’s not so hard.
Hannah: 
Now another question. This is about 
potatoes. How much ±at is there in an 
order o± ±ries? Do you know?
Greg: 
A lot?
Hanna: 
You’re right. There are 15 grams o± ±at in 
a small order o± ±ries. But there’s no ±at in 
a plain baked potato. That’s 15 grams in 
the ±ries and no grams in the baked! But 
remember, no butter! So the next time you 
have potatoes, think baked, not ±ried.
Greg: 
Wow. I don’t believe it! 
Hannah: 
Yes. And one more thing, listen to your 
wi±e! She’s right. Those vegetables and 
±ruit are good ±or you. Thanks a lot ±or 
calling The Food Show. We have time ±or 
one more call.
