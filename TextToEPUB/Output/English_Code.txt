Intro:
Here we stand: children of every age,
This is our world and the world’s our stage.
We can laugh, we can cry – we can float, we can fly,
We can dance, we can sing – we can do almost anything
in 
OUR
world … our
beautiful
world.
Verse 
1
:
Some of us are small; some of us are tall,
Some of us are shy; some say hi to everybody,
Some of us like numbers; some of us love words,
Some of us watch football, and some of us watch the birds!
(Chorus)
This is 
our
world 
… we’re different but the same.
We live and learn together – we get to know each other …
in 
OUR
world … our
beautiful
world.
Verse 2:
Some of us like music; some of us like cars,
Some of us draw pictures, looking at the stars,
Some of us are scientists, trying to find the code,
All of us can help a friend and give a hand to hold.
This is 
our
world
– there’s room for everyone.
We learn to live together, and we have a lot of fun …
In 
our
world … in 
our
world … in our beautiful world!

Do you know where the world’s largest maze is located? It’s in 
China and it’s called the 
Dream Maze
. There are many different 
paths in the 
Dream Maze
. The walls of the paths are tall hedges.
There are resting places inside the maze. There’s a lot of walking 
to do inside the maze and people can get tired. It’s a good idea 
to wear the right clothes and strong shoes because the paths 
have got rocks and stones. There’s no water inside the maze, so 
it’s important to bring a bottle of water. Most importantly, don’t 
lose your family and friends in the maze, especially your children.

At the weekend, Shelly invited her friends to a picnic for her birthday. The picnic was in 
the local forest. Everyone played and had fun. They ran under the waterfall for a while.
Shelly’s mum put the picnic food out on a blanket. There was chicken and salad. There 
was a big birthday cake as well. Then she called everyone to come and eat.
‘Where’s the salad?’ shouted Shelly. Then the children saw the rabbits under the trees. 
They had the salad. They were very happy. They loved salad for lunch.
‘Hurry up and eat the chicken!’ said Shelly’s mum.
‘Mum!’ shouted Shelly. ‘Rover’s looking at my birthday cake!’ The children looked at 
Rover. They all loved Shelly’s dog, but he was famous for stealing cake.
‘Let’s sing Happy Birthday quickly!’ said Shelly’s mum. They all laughed.

The Chinese invented chopsticks 4000 years ago in Henan Province. They made 
the first chopsticks out of twigs. They used them for stirring food in the cooking 
pot. Later, the Chinese began to use chopsticks to eat their food at the table. 
There were knives in China before chopsticks, but Confucius, the famous Chinese 
philosopher, was a vegetarian. He didn’t want to use knives at the table.
Did you know that Chinese people use chopsticks to eat breakfast, too? What do the Chinese eat 
for breakfast nowadays with their chopsticks? Most people have fried rice, fried noodles, beef, 
dumplings, pancakes or vegetables. They drink milk, soya milk or orange juice.

Hi Pamela!
Guess what! I entered the Crowford Primary Spring Writing Competition and I wrote 
a shape poem. I had to create a poem and then write it in a shape. I had to use 
describing and feeling words. It was difficult but I think I wrote a good poem. It was 
about a river that passes through many different landscapes like hills, forests, caves 
and jungles as it travels thousands of kilometres from the mountains to the beach.
The prize was a holiday at a lake. And guess what again! I won! Lucky me!!

What do you do when you are ill? You probably go to see 
your local doctor. And if you are very ill, you go to hospital 
for a few days. But it’s completely different if you live in the 
Australian Outback. There are no doctors there and no 
hospitals, either. So, what do people do when they are ill? 
They call the Flying Doctor Service!
The Flying Doctor Service looks after the health of people living in the Outback. Doctors fly 
in planes long distances to see patients on farms. They bring nurses and medicines with 
them. It’s an excellent service. Flying doctors help people every two minutes on average 
in the Australian Outback! They have over 60 aeroplanes. In 
2017, the planes flew more than 26 million kilometres. That’s 
like 34 trips to the Moon and back!
Sometimes the planes can land on small airstrips near farms, 
but sometimes there are no airstrips, so they have to land on 
flat land or motorways. The farmers and their friends light 
these temporary runways with their car headlights if it’s dark. 
If the ill person needs special treatment or an operation, the 
plane becomes a flying ambulance. The doctors and nurses put the patient in 
the plane and fly the patient to the nearest hospital.

Slices for 5 children:
3
Slices for 7 children:
Imagine you’ve got an apple pie. Eight people want a slice, 
so you are going to cut eight slices. Now imagine you take the 
first slice from that pie. That slice is one eighth of the apple pie.
When you write a fraction, the top number is the slice you 
took from the apple pie, the bottom number is the total 
number of slices.

/8 is how you write that fraction.

Yesterday, Grandma made a cake. She always 
makes rectangular cakes. She made a rectangular 
one yesterday, too. She cut the cake into eighths.
She gave one slice to Arabella and another to 
Grandad. Arabella divided her slice into two 
halves and shared it with her baby brother.
How much of the whole cake did Arabella

This is the year’s best film for people who like a good

The special effects are great. There are a lot of 
explosions because the mystery is set in an oil field. 
This makes it the most frightening and exciting film
in the series.

This is one of the funniest films I’ve ever seen. It is full 
of great jokes and the acting is hilarious. It is about a 
police officer who loves his patrol car. When someone 
steals his car, he must go through many crazy and 
funny experiences to get it back. You’ll love it!

I’m playing football 
with my teammates.
What are you 
doing on Saturday?
It’s the funniest film this year! The main character is called Lucas Delucia. The actor who plays him
is Cameron Buttersworth. He’s my favourite actor because I think he’s really good at doing 
funny scenes.
At the beginning of the film, Lucas meets a group of neighbourhood kids who want to solve an 
old town mystery. They are all bored because they’ve got nothing to do over the summer. All the 
characters in the film are very silly and very funny. I love the film because a lot of interesting and crazy 
things happen. The special effects are amazing, too. The best part is when the mayor is chasing them 
down the street on a scooter.
I think children, teenagers and adults will love this film. 
Lucas at Work 
is a fantastic live action comedy film.

What is special about the way the artists create the drawings?
The artists 
.
Anime cartoons are famous all over the world. ‘Anime’ is the Japanese 
word for animations. Anime characters usually resemble real people. 
They’ve got large eyes and they’re very expressive. Landscapes are 
important, too. When a character is angry, the landscape reflects this: 
the sky turns purple along with the character’s hair and eyes! When a 
character is happy, the sky is bright and clear.
To make anime, Japanese artists create hand-drawn pictures in black and 
white. Each picture is called a frame. The artists put the frames together. 
Then the pictures are put onto a computer and digitally coloured.
To draw 60 to 90 seconds of cartoon takes an anime artist about six 
weeks. We can often see anime episodes on TV. Each episode lasts 
24 minutes and needs 34,560 frames! So next time you see an anime 
clip, think of all the hard work behind it.

The Dog and the Bone

One day, a butcher gave a hungry dog a nice meaty 
bone. The dog was very happy as it walked away 
carrying the bone in its mouth. The dog walked a short 
distance until it reached a bridge. It stopped at the 
centre of the bridge and started its feast. Suddenly, it 
looked down into the water and saw another dog with a 
bone in its mouth. This other dog was looking up with angry eyes. 
The greedy dog thought, ‘I want my bone and that bone, too.’ The dog opened its 
mouth to bark at the dog in the water. As soon as the dog opened its mouth, the bone 
fell with a splash into the stream. The dog jumped into the stream, but of course, there 
was no dog in the water and no bone, either. 
In fact, the dog now had no bone. Its bone 
was at the bottom of the stream and the 
other bone was nothing but a reflection!

One of the most famous spies in American history 
was George Washington. He was a political leader 
and a military general. When he was a secret agent, 
his secret agent name was 711. He was head of a very 
successful group of spies who collected information on 
the movement of enemy soldiers. He led the American 
forces in their War of Independence against the British. 
He later became the first President of the United 
States. During the revolution, he had to send messages 
to his soldiers. He didn’t want the enemy to read and 
understand the messages, so he wrote them in cipher. 
His secret messages helped the United States defeat 
the British army. To keep the messages extra secret, 
Washington helped a man called James Jay to create an 
invisible ink. This was the first invisible ink in history.

Christmas Island is a remote and beautiful 
island off the north coast of Australia. 
There are beaches for swimming and 
snorkelling, rainforests for hiking and 
spectacular waterfalls where tourists enjoy 
taking photographs.
However, the island was also home to 
a curious crime not long ago. Dr Helen 
Barnwell, a research scientist from 
London, visited the island to study 
a group of local marsupials called 
sugar gliders. 
One evening, she 
set up a special 
camera in the trees 
to photograph these 
interesting animals. 
But the next morning 
when she went to check 
her camera, it wasn’t

there. She looked 
around and saw some 
marks on the ground.
Local police officer 
Gloria Hann solved the mystery for Dr Barnwell. 
Officer Hann said, ‘The local coconut crabs are 
the thieves. They have lived on the island for 
hundreds of years. They grab things they think 
are food and carry them away to their holes. 
We call them robber crabs!’

Ancient Romans loved sports. There were indoor and outdoor sports. A popular sport was 
hoop rolling. Ancient Roman children rolled their hoops by hitting them with a stick. 
They had races to see who could roll their hoop fastest.
Chariot racing was very popular, too. The chariots were pulled by horses. The charioteers 
drove their chariots 8.4 kilometres around an oval arena. They drove them very fast. 
The winner won a crown of leaves and a lot of money.
Ludus latrunculorum was an inside sport. It was a board game. Players practised military 
tactics. It was very popular because the Ancient Romans were great soldiers.

Using my best friend’s tablet, 
computer and headphones. 
Having fun. Feeling excited.
Imagine you are telling the story. Write about what happened.
Work in pairs. Share your stories.
